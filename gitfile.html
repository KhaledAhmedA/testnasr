warnning msg appears
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in test1.exe.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
case :

In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with
a line feed (LF). In windows a line is represented with
a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF).
when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system
they will only have an LF.
If you are a single developer working on a windows machine,
and you don't care that git automatically replaces
LFs to CRLFs, you can turn this warning off by typing the
following in the git command line

git config core.autocrlf true



git branch / git branch branchName
git checkout newBranchName
git merge branchName
